This paper examines how American society promotes or prevents social mobility. First, the paper contains a short review of the theories of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu and the social science concepts of social heritage, social mobility, habitus and the forms of capital. This if followed by a rhetorical analysis of two speeches by Barack Obama: “Reclaiming the American Dream” (2007) and “Remarks by the President on Economic Mobility” (2013). The analysis focuses mainly on how Obama uses rhetorical devices to portray the American Dream in terms of social mobility, and how his views on the American Dream changes between the two speeches. This will be used as a starting point for the discussion, where the advantages and disadvantages of the American social welfare model, in relation to social mobility, will be compared to Bourdieu’s theory and statistics comparing the United States to Denmark.

This paper examines in vitro meat and its possibilities of becoming an alternative to livestock production of meat in the US. In order to do so, an account of current scientific understanding of stem cells is given. The perception of in vitro meat by Americans is considered through stylistic and argumentative analyses of two recent articles: Jeff Bercovici’s “Why this cardiologist is betting that his lab‐grown meat startup can solve the global food crisis” (2017) and Ryan F. Mandelbaum’s “Behind the hype of ‘lab‐grown’ meat” (2017). There is a clear indication of a general public optimism on the subject. Although it will not be possible for in vitro meat to substitute meat in the near future, in vitro meat can become a significant long term competitor if research is financed.

This paper examines the alteration in behavior that may occur if an individual is under potential constant surveillance. An outline is given of Michel Foucault’s ”disciplinary society”, an expression that was derived from an experimental prison created by the architect Jeremy Bentham, whose Panopticon will be further discussed throughout the paper. These theories are taken into account in an analysis of Bruce Miller’s 2017 HBO-adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s *The Handmaid’s Tale*. Through a character-driven analysis, it is shown how cinematic devices are used to portray the patriarchal, dystopian society of Gilead, and the great role surveillance  plays in maintaining control. The real-world relevance of the television show is discussed by including empirical data from a survey among students and teachers at Silkeborg Gymnasium, Denmark. It is shown that, like the fictional scenario, the actual surveillance found in today’s society is characterized by a change in behavior. However, the level of concern for surveillance depends on what type of individual you are.
