		It was at a party, of sorts. They were in a sprawling-browned field behind a friend of a friend’s house that butted up against a cheap par three golf course. There was a trampoline where a couple Caroline didn’t know lay talking about their favorite animals. 
		<span style="font-size: 85%;">[…]</span> No one was home, no one was golfing, and they had no view of the road. It felt so adult, how alone they were, Caroline thought. Zach was manic, alternating telling stories about fights he got in (and won) <span style="font-size: 85%;">[…]</span>. He lit a fire in an old Folger’s tin, feeding in pieces of scrap paper and dead leaves, telling them to use their imaginations, that they were all around a brilliantly huge bonfire near a lake, a river instead of some cruddy backyard. 
		And while Zach talked to Kelly and some other girl she didn’t know, flirted with them by flexing and telling them how fast he could run, Caroline studied his aquiline nose and strawberry blond hair and felt the desire to tussle it. 
		<span style="font-size: 85%;">[…]</span> they met Zach – who was working as a custodian at the speedway for the summer – and snuck around the back of the tall barbed-wire fence that circled the speedway, near turn three.

		The house gave away its secrets more easily, and I got to know it well. It was four floors altogether. Leah lived at the top. She slept in the back room, in a canopy bed, and in the front one she kept an upright Steinway under a stained-glass skylight; at certain hours of the afternoon, the ivory keys became streaked with color. Before I met Leah, I’d been intimidated by the idea of the place she held in Yoav’s life. He referred to her often in conversation, sometimes as my sister, and sometimes just as she, and frequently he spoke of the two of them collectively. When her playing stopped, I was sure that she was watching from somewhere in the house, and the hair on my arm would rise. But when Lea finally appeared for the first time I was surprised at how slight and unassuming she was <span style="font-size: 85%;">[…]</span>. She seemed held together by some great pressure exerted from within. She kept a second piano, a baby grand, in a study on the ground floor. Sheet music was stacked everywhere. These pages migrated through the house, turning up in the kitchen and bathrooms. She spent a week or two memorizing a piece, breaking it down into smaller and smaller parts. She wore an old cotton kimono and rarely got dressed.

            Finally, after her third gin and tonic, the door bangs open and the boys arrive. The committee girls get up and start teasing them, scolding them for being late, things like that. Marianne hangs back, searching for Connell’s eye contact, which he doesn’t return. He’s dressed in a white button-down shirt, the same Adidas sneakers he wears everywhere. The other boys are wearing shirts too, but more formal-looking, shinier, and worn with leather dress shoes. There’s a heavy, stirring smell of aftershave in the air. Eric catches Marianne’s eye and suddenly lets go of Karen, a move obvious enough that everyone else looks around too.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel starts laughing, leans in to say something in Connell’s ear. He turns his face away slightly and doesn’t laugh along. Marianne feels a pressure in her head that she wants to relieve by screaming or crying.

		There are even more people farther on, in Times Square, though the cars have been blocked and so there’s that, at least – one less thing. “Hurry up,” Ginny says, maneuvering the girls around the tables and chairs, the feet, the flocks of pigeons, the remnants of lunches consumed. Men and women she may or may not recognize – movie stars, rappers, models – loom above them, magnified a thousand percent, their eyes the size of swimming pools <span style="font-size: 85%;">[…]</span>. The movie stars, rappers, and models are invariably smiling, cheerful; some sing or dance, the women with suggestive postures, the men in dark glasses and fur coats.

The breeze picks up, eddying ticket stubs and wrappers and waxed paper and brown bags and plastic straws and whatever else has been left behind. <span style="font-size: 85%;">[…]</span> Recently, a flock of plastic bags has caught in the spindly sycamore in front of their apartment, empty bags that inflate and deflate with the wind like marooned sailing ships.

		Gavin cooked for Kay at his house that evening, opening tins and crushing garlic with a sense of ill-usage.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a row, you had to say certain things to secure a truce: those were the rules, everyone knew that. Gavin had telephoned Kay from his car on the way back from Barry’s burial and told her <span style="font-size: 85%;">[…]</span> that he hoped he could see her that night. He considered these humble admissions no more or less than the price he had to pay for an evening of undemanding companionship.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kay seemed to consider them more in the light of a down payment on a renegotiated contract. <i>You missed me. You needed me when you were upset. You’re sorry we didn’t go as a couple. Well let’s not make that mistake again</i>. There had been a certain complacency about the way she had treated him since; a briskness, a sense of renewed expectation.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was making spaghetti Bolognese tonight; he had deliberately omitted to buy a pudding or to lay the table in advance; he was at pains to show her that he had not made much of an effort. Kay seemed oblivious, even determined to take this casual attitude as a compliment. She sat at his small kitchen table, talking to him over the pitter-patter of rain on the skylight, her eyes wandering over the fixtures and fittings. She had not often been here.

		Henry Hill was introduced to life in the mob almost by accident. In 1955, when he was eleven years old, he wandered into a drab, paint-flecked cabstand at 391 Pine Street, near Pitkin Avenue, in the Brownsville-East New York section of Brooklyn, looking for a part-time, after-school job. The one-story, storefront cabstand and dispatch office was directly across the street from where he lived with his mother, father, four older sisters, and two brothers, and Henry had been intrigued by the place almost as far back as he could remember. Even before he went to work there Henry had seen the long black Cadillacs and Lincolns glide into the block. He had watched the expressionless faces of the cabstand visitors, and he always remembered their huge, wide coats. Some of the visitors were so large that when they hauled themselves out of their cars, the vehicles rose by inches. He saw glittering rings and jewel-studded belt buckles and thick gold wrist bands holding wafer-thin platinum watches.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men at the cabstand were not like anyone else from the neighborhood. They wore silk suits in the morning and would drape the fenders of their cars with handkerchiefs before leaning back for a talk. He had watched them double-park their cars and never get tickets, even when they parked smack in front of a fire hydrant. In the winter he had seen the city's sanitation trucks plow the snow from the cabstand's parking lot before getting around to cleaning the school yard and hospital grounds.

		The evening sun middled the sky like a piece of glowing coal taken out of fire and left to cool down. It held back its flames, yet made sure to cast its blazing shadows on the surroundings before it set. I flew closer and closer to the sun, yet it didn’t hurt me to come that close. It was a cold sun, old, just like myself; and as I was starting my voyage, it was getting ready to leave for another destination.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast space was embraced in perfect stillness, void of any movement except for the nomadic birds passing by, greeting me with a side glance or a wag of tail. Beneath me were scattered oil ships and fishing boats that appeared from above like puffs of cloud floating in a lower sky; a perfect reflection of my upper surroundings.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It dawned on me that I was completely alone – no humans, no nothing. I felt alarmingly free, and that scared me, and the only way to shake the fear was to keep on flying towards nowhere; and I did it for long hours until there was no light to be seen, except for the navigational beam of the distant lighthouse, and some glowing unidentified shapes beneath me.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After long aimless flying, I gave in to fatigue. My stomach rumbled with hunger. I needed somewhere to land and something to eat. A couple of scattered boats beneath me glowed amid the darkness. <i>One of these boats will do</i>, I thought.

		It seems they’re expected to wade out to the boat. The old couple with the matching binoculars go first. They’re both wearing wide-legged khaki-shorts, which they roll up even farther, exposing stringy whitish legs which are surprisingly muscular. Even so, the drooping bottoms of their shorts are wet through by the time they reach the boat’s ladder. The two speckled pink girls make it with a lot of shrieking. Lora unties her tie dye, under which she’s wearing a black bikini half a size too small, and drapes it around her neck. She holds the purple cloth bag she’s carrying at shoulder height and surges into the water; surf breaks around her thighs, which bulge out of the bikini like caricatures of thighs. <span style="font-size: 90%">[…]</span> Rennie considers her options.

Every small element of life fascinated him and he wanted to get it right. <span style="font-size: 85%;">[…]</span>

He brought the nest inside and taught me how to feed the chicks with a dropper. Two of them died, but one survived, and he put everything into the life of that bird. He took a pencil and pointed to the bulging purple skin that seemed to cover the bird's eyes and he showed me the place where its heart was beating.

Howard moved away to the other side of their kitchen-diner to attend to a singing kettle. There was only this one high note – the rest was silence. Their only daughter, Zora, sat on a stool with her back to the room, her earphones on, looking up reverentially at the television. Levi, the youngest boy, stood beside his father in front of the kitchen cabinets. And now the two of them began to choreograph a breakfast in speechless harmony: passing the box of cereal from one to the other, exchanging implements, filling their bowls and sharing milk from a pink china jug with a sun-yellow rim. The house was south facing. Light struck the double glass doors that led to the garden, filtering through the arch that split the kitchen. It rested softly upon the still life of Kiki at the breakfast table, motionless, reading. A dark red Portuguese earthenware bowl faced her, piled high with apples. At this hour the light extended itself even further, beyond the breakfast table, through the hall, to the lesser of their two living rooms. Here a bookshelf filled with their oldest paperbacks kept company with a suede beanbag and an ottoman upon which Murdoch, their dachshund, lay collapsed in a sunbeam.

		Tom gropes amongst the old shoe-boxes, fallen scarves, gloves, and belts, breathing in faded wafts of Sandra. Instead of the soft give of Sandra’s suede bag, his fingers find something hard. A smooth glass column. He draws it out carefully. The green of the bottle is so dark it’s almost black. It has the classic gold hood encasing the cork and neck. <i>Moët & Chandon Grand Vintage 1988</i>. The 1988 is inscribed in a dramatic flourish of white digits across the front of the label.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a waste. Undrinkable now. Vintage, so a bit more longevity, but Champagne is generally short-lived. All tangy fizz and excitement at the beginning, but it’s not a keeper. He slumps onto his bottom on the bedroom floor and cradles the bottle in both hands. […]
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dives back in the wardrobe and finds the bag, agerashed<span style="font-size:85%;"><sup style="line-height: 0.4em;">1</sup></span> and giving off a strange mix of Ysatis<span style="font-size:85%;"><sup style="line-height: 0.4em;">2</sup></span> and mould. He takes the bottle and the bag downstairs. They sit together on the island as he scurries about unloading the dishwasher and tidying up. Not that there’s much to tidy up. Without Sandra and Freya everything stays in its place. He sprays the work surfaces and wonders if Sandra will be on time and whether she’ll stop for a bit. His eyes keep coming back to the Moët and the bloody clutch. He gets an ice-cooler from the freezer and shoves it over the bottle. Maybe it’s drinkable; he doesn’t like to waste.

		Halted on the inside lane, Robyn catches the eye of a young West Indian with Rastafarian dreadlocks, hunched in the entrance of a boarded-up shop, and smiles, a friendly, sympathetic, anti-racist smile. To her alarm the young man immediately straightens up, takes his hands out of the pockets of his black leather jacket, and comes over to her car, stooping to bring his head level with the window. He mouths something through the glass which she cannot hear. The car in front moves forward a few yards, but when Robyn inches forward in turn the young man lays a restraining hand on the Renault’s wing. Robyn leans across the passenger seat and winds the window down a little way. <span style="font-size: 75%;">[…]</span>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robyn sees a roadsign to West Wallsbury, the area in which <i>J. Pringle & Sons</i> is situated, and gratefully follows it.

		Connie looked down at the scalpel in her hand. Quicksilver-thin blade, ivory handle. To the untrained eye, it looked like a stiletto. In other houses, it would be mistaken for a paring knife for vegetables or fruit. 
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not flesh. 
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connie cradled the dead jackdaw in her hands, feeling the memory of warmth and life in its dead muscle and sinew and vein, in the heavy droop of its neck. <i>Corvus monedula</i><sup style="line-height: 0.6em; font-size: 75%;">1</sup>. Black glossy birds, with ash-grey necks and crowns. 
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale eyes. Almost white.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her tools were ready. An earthenware bowl with a mixture of water and arsenical soap. Several strips of cloth, and a pail on the floor at her feet. Newspaper. Pliers and scalpel and file.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently Connie laid the bird down on the paper. With her fingers, she parted the sooty feathers and lined up the blade at the top of the breast bone. Then, with the anticipation she always felt at the moment of incision, she manoeuvred the tip into place, looking for the best point of entry. 
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jackdaw lay still, accepting of its fate. She breathed in and slowly exhaled. A ritual of sorts. […]
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfumes of the trade were pungent – alcohol, the musty odour of flax tow, linseed oil, the paints for the claws and feet, beaks and mounts – too strong for a child’s sensibilities. Over the years, Connie had become accustomed to them and now she barely noticed. If anything, she believed that acknowledging the scent of things was an integral part of the process.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced up at the high windows that ran the length of the workshop, tilted open today to let in the fresh air. The sky was a welcome shock of blue after the weeks of rain. She wondered if she might persuade her father to come down for lunch. Perhaps a cup of beef tea?

		Bas lumbered over a crooked line of paver stones that led to the stairs, which he climbed one at a time to the porch. Bas held open the screen door to knock shyly on the main door. No lights came on inside.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reed might’ve forgotten all about Bas. He might’ve even forgotten about me. Bas went to the window, cupped his hands around his eyes, and looked inside. The train’s reflection ran in one side of his head and out the other. He moved down the porch to the next window. The train ended, and as it continued westward, the street fell silent. I heard Bas breathing hard as he descended from the porch. I heard each stair creak under his weight. I saw the railing, made of galvanized pipe, shake. Bas stopped on the paver stones, halfway to his Cadillac. From there, he looked across the street right at me, standing under the water tower in a moon shadow. But that wasn’t why Bas didn’t see me. He was thinking about Cheyenne, and wondering who she was with. He was conjuring, for himself, an image of Reed, which made me invisible.

		Pepe flipped the beer mat over and back while he waited. He slid it forward with his thumb until it overhung the counter edge and then flicked it up from below with the tops of his fingers so it hopped into the air. He always managed to catch it before it landed.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his drink came, he laid out the beer mat before pushing the usual handful of dollar bills across the lacquered wood and then sipped his beer in small mouthfuls, watching as the foamy white rings banded the inside of the glass like a coati’s tail. The barman knew to keep serving until the money was up.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other miners heckled Pepe now. A scab, they called him, a Judas and a turncoat. <span style="font-size: 90%">[…]</span> The taverna<sup style="line-height: 0.4em;">1</sup> where the other miners still drank was raucous and the barman there served quickly, tossed shakers over his shoulder and opened bottles behind his back. This barman was different; he was awkward and slow and his rusty movements seemed to drag out the evenings interminably and Pepe liked that just fine.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pepe drank in silence as the frothy head of his beer dissipated, arranging itself into shapes which floated on the yellow body below: a map of Bolivia, a sleeping fruit bat, a toy car.
